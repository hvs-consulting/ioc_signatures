# Unattributed IOCs

## Context
- We found those IOCs in a 2024 investigation of a compromised Windows environment. Unfortunately we were able to correlate any IOC to known threat-actors.

## Notes & Disclaimer
- Even if we try to avoid false positives by manual QA, those rules are not meant to be used in production without previous dry runs.
