# Quarterly IOCs
- Last update: 22.08.2024

## Context
This is our quarterly IOC feed, where we publish IOCs from ongoing incidents. These incidents are often unattributed or minor, making an additional folder unnecessary. However, we still want to share the IOCs from these incidents.
## Notes & Disclaimer
- Even if we try to avoid false positives by manual QA, those rules are not meant to be used in production without previous dry runs.
