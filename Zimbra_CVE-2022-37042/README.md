# Zimbra IOCs
- Last update: 23.08.2022

## Context
- We found these IOCs during an investigation of a compromised Zimbra server in 2022. The threat actor(s) used the vulnerability CVE-2022-37042 to compromise the Zimbra server and drop webshells. More information regarding this vulnerability can be found in Volexity's blog post referenced in the section References.

In order to identify exploitation attempts on your Zimbra server, you can search your access logs for requests to the endpoint "mboximport":

```
<ip_attacker> - - [02/Aug/2022:10:50:49 +0200] "POST /service/extension/backup/mboximport?account-name=admin&ow=1&no-switch=true HTTP/1.1" 401 287 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:101.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/101.0" "-"
```

Other IOCs, comprised in the CSV file, can help you in finding dropped webshells after a successful exploitation.

## Notes & Disclaimer
- Even if we try to avoid false positives by manual QA, those rules are not meant to be used in production without previous dry runs.
