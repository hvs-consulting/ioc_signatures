# NFS Security Tooling

- Last update: 22.10.2024

## Context
Our HvS Pentesting colleagues have identified attacks against NFS and developed pentesting tools specifically for NFS. You can learn more about it here:
https://www.hvs-consulting.de/en/nfs-security-identifying-and-exploiting-misconfigurations/

As part of our commitment to enhancing global security, these tools were designed to help other pentesters identify the same vulnerabilities and assist companies in eliminating them from their environments. Additionally, we invested time into creating detection signatures to identify the presence of our pentesting tools. These detection signatures enable security analysts to identify these tool, which enables them to verify that the tools are being used in a legitimate way.


## Notes & Disclaimer
- Even if we try to avoid false positives by manual QA, those rules are not meant to be used in production without previous dry runs.
